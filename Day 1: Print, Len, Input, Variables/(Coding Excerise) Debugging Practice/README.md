## Debugging

### Instructions

Look at the code in main.py 

There are errors in all of the lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors.

### Example Output

When you run your program, it should print the following:

`Day 1 - Lecture 1.6 - String Manuplation & Indentation`

`Indentation is most important in Python!`

`New lines can be created with a backslash and n.`

All The Best! ðŸ¤œ
