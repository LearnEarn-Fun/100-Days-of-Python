## Odd or Even

### Instructions

Write a program for A Odd or Even Number Checker!

Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder. 

Example: 86 is **even** because 86 Ã· 2 = 43

43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.

e.g. 59 is **odd** because 59 Ã· 2 = 29.5

29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.

**Warning:** Your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops. 

### Example Input 1

```
43
```

### Example Output 1

```
43 is a odd number.
```

### Example Input 2

```
94
```

### Example Output 2

```
94 is a even number.
```


### Hint

1. All even numbers can be divided by 2 with 0 remainder.
