## BMI Calculator 2.0

### Instructions

Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

- Under 18.5 - "You are underweight!"
- Over 18.5 but below 25 - "You have normal weight!"
- Over 25 but below 30 - "You are slightly overweight!"
- Over 30 but below 35 - "You are obese!"
- Above 35 - "You are clinically obese!"


**Warning:** you should **round** the result to the nearest whole number.

### Example Input

```
weight = 85
```

```
height = 1.75
```

### Example Output

85 ÷ (1.75 x 1.75) =  27.755102040816325

```
Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight.
```

All The Best! 🤜
